### What to expect? 🗺️

A blurry landscape of ideas, trying to come into focus over time. 

**I’ve always loved  the art of the short stories**; all the characters step onto the stage and instantly pull you into their story. They have but a fleeting moment to seize your focus and, depending on their part, provoke hatred, annoyance, or fascination—or simply leave no trace at all.
I especially love *Tutto in un punto*, from Italo Calvino’s collection *Le Cosmicomiche*. And I think it is enough.


### Coming Soon... 🏗️
I'd like to use this spot to share ideas adn learning progresses. See you 🌿
