Hello! I am a mathematician into Cybersecurity. It is nice to see network defense as a large-scale modeling problem,  where algebra, graph theory, and automation meet to solve real-world security challenges.
 
### Numerical Analysis & Image Processing
My research focused on **Numerical Analysis** and **Image Processing**, specifically investigating the reconstruction of surfaces featuring **jump discontinuities** through interpolation. I employed piecewise **monotone-preserving interpolants**, which remain a powerful tool for balancing high-order accuracy with monotonicity. My work centered on constructing interpolants using **custom non-linear means** to recover 2D properties that are typically only guaranteed in the univariate case.

### Graph Theory & Anomaly Detection
I have a strong interest in **Graph Theory**, and modeling through graphs.  particularly in **planarity problems**. In the cyber world, I relate this to **Network Topology Analysis**:
* **Graph-based Detection**: Instead of simple logs, I see network traffic as a dynamic graph.
* **Structural Anomalies**: I'm exploring how changes in graph centralities or the appearance of unexpected edges can signal lateral movement or C2 activities.

## 🛡️ Microsoft Azure & Sentinel Operations

I am currently blue teaming as a **SOC Analyst**, and my dayly key-words are:

* **KQL (Kusto Query Language)** 💎: My primary tool for querying and correlating security telemetries across **EDR** (Endpoint Detection and Response), firewalls, and identity providers. I use it to build complex hunting logic that connects disparate data points into a coherent attack narrative.
* **Workbooks** 📊: I develop these to transform fragmented logs into centralized, interactive dashboards. They are essential for visualizing the "blast radius" of an incident and providing a clear, quantitative view of the infrastructure's security posture.
* **Playbooks** ⚙️: Leveraging **Logic Apps** to automate repetitive triage tasks. These orchestrations integrate with **OSINT** 🔍 sources to automatically enrich alerts with external threat intelligence, significantly reducing the Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).

## 🔭 Learning Goals


* Getting in  **Anomaly Detection**: I like to deduce hacker behavior through analytics. I aim to design and implement Anomaly Detection pipelines. 🚀

* Implementing MLOps orchestration, mastering Docker.
